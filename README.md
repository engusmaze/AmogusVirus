# Very bad written virus

This virus was created for fun.

I tested it with different antiviruses and they just removed my virus, so yeah ...

It works like a really bad win-locker.

And this virus is really laggy.

## How it works

On first launch, it will ask for administrator rights.

Then it is added to startup.

The "amogus video" will then start playing full screen and cannot be stopped with ALT + F4 or CTRL + ALT + DELETE.

## How to setup

### You can download working program on releases page or compile it by yourself

I used python 3.7.* to create this thing

But it will also work on 3.6.* - 3.8.* versions

Don't try to run this thing on versions higher than 3.8

### Python modules needed to run this thing:
- pyinstaller
- pyglet
- mouse
- keyboard
- psutil

Then run compile.bat to get working program in folder with virus
